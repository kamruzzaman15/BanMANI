# BanMANI
This is the Benchmark Dataset for identifying manipulated social media news in Bangla

Both the train and test data are in the BanMANI.csv file. 

In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method for generating such a dataset, which allows scalable dataset collection using annotators efficiently for languages like Bamgla with few available NLP tools. We also use zero-shot ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and fine-tune GPT-3 to evaluate our dataset. 

This paper is accepted and presented at the 16th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora,Â Co-located with RANLP 2023, and incorporates the first Workshop on Computational Terminology in NLP and Translation Studies (ConTeNTs), Varna, Bulgaria.
